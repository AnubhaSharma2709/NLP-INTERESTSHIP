This folder contains some of the tasks assigned to students for exploring and understanding the data.

- **Task -1 : Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 
1. You have to come up with atleast 2 graphs, and derive information from these graphs to fully understanding the data.
2. **Note:** I am not interested in the number of graphs, but in the information you extracted from that graph.
